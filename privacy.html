    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: February 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the <strong>Theory of Referentiality</strong> mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>While the app itself does not require a user account or manual input of personal data (such as names or emails), it does utilize automated data collection tools via third-party SDKs to function effectively.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We may collect and transmit Device IDs or Advertising IDs (such as the Google Advertising ID) to facilitate advertising and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>App Performance Data:</strong> We may collect diagnostic information, such as crash logs and app performance metrics, to improve user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>To provide monetization and support, this app shares specific data with the following third parties:</p>
    <p><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used for advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data such as your IP address, device identifiers, and approximate location (at the city level) to serve relevant ads. For more information, please visit: 
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Encryption and Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your information. All data transmitted off the device by our third-party partners is handled via <strong>encrypted protocols (HTTPS)</strong> to ensure security during transit.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is <strong>not</strong> specifically designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
