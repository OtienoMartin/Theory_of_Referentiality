# Theory of Referentiality

Experimental proof and foundational equations by Otieno Martin Owuor.

## Main Document
- [On the Experimental Proof of the Fundamental Equations of the Theory of Referentiality.pdf](./On%20the%20Proofs%20of%20the%20Fundamental%20Equations%20for%20the%20Theory%20of%20Referentiality.pdf) — Full paper with setup diagrams and derivations.

## Key Claims
- Proportionality constant in Newton's second law is ½ (F = ½ ma)
- Implications for third law, momentum conservation, and unification of forces
- Equations extend to quantum regime and account for gravity, electromagnetism, weak force
